In this method:
for (var i=0; i < items.length; i++) {
JS has to determine the length of items each and every loop.

Instead, you can declare an additional variable, len, and then JS needs only to do a simple comparison of the two variables each and every loop:
for (var i=0, len=items.length; ++i < len;) {

Also note the use of ++i in the comparison versus i++ as the third parameter of the for loop. This is documented as a faster incrementing method by Paul Irish: http://paulirish.com/i/d9f0.png
